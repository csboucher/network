<h1>Homework #5</h1>
<h3></h3><p></p>
<h2>Bison Dominance: This data shows a two month time period where bison were observed and their aggressive behavior was recorded .
    This data set only inlcudes aggressive interactions where the winner and looser could be catagoized unambiguously.
    This data was collected in Moiese, Montana by Dale F Lott and can be found at https://bansallab.github.io/asnr/data.html.</h2>

<h3>Hypothesis: I hypothesize that there is a clear dominant bison within this pack which will be shown by a large number of
    wins compared to the other bison in the herd.

    The matrix show the network from bison number 1-25 and their total numbers of aggresive interactions. This starts to
    show more of a pattern but there is still not a clear dominant bison

    The first dot plot shows the 1-25 bison and the number of aggressive interactions they won.The second shows the Bison number and
    number of losses.
